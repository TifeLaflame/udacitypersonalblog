            I’ve read twenty books in 2020 and plan to read at least four more before the end of the year. Reading allows me to see how others convey their message and learn lessons from those who are much wiser than myself. Every time I come across a book that piques my interest, whether it’s referenced in a book or a conversation, I note it down. This habit led me to a bloated list of 327 book titles.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I continue my reading pace of twenty-four books per year, it’ll take me thirteen years to get through the current list, and who knows how many books I’ll add between now and then?
          </p>
          <p>
            The website GoodReads’ tagline is to “Meet your next favorite book.” Yet how am I supposed to do this if I have to sift through 327 titles?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is by no means at the fault of GoodReads, or any of the well-intentioned readers who recommend a title. This is my own doing, my own fear of missing out, my own desire to do it all.
